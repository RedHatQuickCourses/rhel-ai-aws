:navtitle: Home

== Introduction

Welcome to this quick course on _Deploying RHEL AI on AWS_.

Before diving into this training, let’s consider the following scenario:

* Imagine you’re tasked with setting up RHEL AI in a dynamic cloud environment, where businesses rely on scalable AI solutions to handle complex data processing tasks.
* RHEL AI, deployed on an AWS instance, serves as the backbone for powerful AI-driven operations, providing the infrastructure needed to run AI workloads efficiently. 
* However, deploying RHEL AI in the cloud requires creating a custom AMI, setting up the environment, and configuring AWS resources to ensure seamless performance.

In this hands-on lab, you’ll take the reins, learn how to create a RHEL AI AMI image, upload it to an S3 bucket, and deploy it on AWS.
With each step, you’ll gain deeper insight into managing AI infrastructure in the cloud, from provisioning resources to configuring your instance for real-world AI tasks.

By the end, you’ll be fully equipped to deploy AI platforms in cloud environments, making you a key player in the future of AI-driven cloud solutions.
